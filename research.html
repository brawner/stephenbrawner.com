		<p class="projtitle">Robot Simulation Computing Cluster (aka the Cheese Farm)</p>
		
		<p class="projdescription">How many people actually have access to high powered and fully capable modern robots? At the Brown Robotics lab, we intend to bring more people in to the current state of robotics by maintaining a cluster of computers that run simulated instances of robots running the ROS platform. Utilizing Rosbridge, which was developed at Brown, any user with a web socket enabled browser can connect into one of these running instances. For education purposes, utilizing tools like ROSProcessingjs, we can allow novices to program Processing code in their web browser and see the results on the screen.</p>
		<p class="projdescription">Robot videos are great, but you know what's better? Real-time interaction with robots. Most non-experts probably don't understand the level of autonomy illustrated in youtube demo videos. How do they know what are contrived versus substantial demos? The cheese farm also provides a great way to show off the projects happening at Brown. Through their own interaction, interested visitors can tryout the systems for themselves. Did I mention, this is a live video feed?</p>

		<p class="projtitle">CAD <=> Simulation</p>
		
		<p class="projdescription">The current robot design paradigm encourages the mechanical and electrical hardware to be developed first and then the software. But what if the software was already done, do you have to wait until you have built a system to test it out on this software? Robotics designers encounter this with ROS all the time. There is a huge library of software already developed. How could the robotic design process improve, if with a few clicks the design could be brought up in the ROS Gazebo simulator and tested with a variety of ROS stacks. This is my next direction of research and I will be working at Willow Garage this summer to flesh it out.</p>
